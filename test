Yes, you can copy the HTML code as is. It's a complete, standalone file that includes:

1. Basic structure with HTML5 doctype
2. Meta tags for responsiveness
3. TailwindCSS CDN for styling
4. Font Awesome for icons
5. A clean, responsive layout with:
   - Header with transport logo and city info
   - Current weather section
   - Transport status cards
   - Hourly and 3-day forecasts
   - Footer with attribution

The JavaScript functionality would need to be implemented separately (the code references `meteo.js` which isn't included here), but the UI structure is complete.

To use it:
1. Copy the entire code
2. Save as an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`)
3. Open in a browser

Note: For full functionality, you'll need to:
- Create the `C` file for weather data fetching
- Potentially add the missing `style.css` if you need custom styles beyond Tailwind
- Set up any required API connections for real weather/transport data
